What does goodFeaturesToTrack do?

Function calculates the corner quality measure at every source image pixel using the cornerMinEigenVal() or cornerHarris() .

Function performs a non-maximum suppression (the local maximums in 3 x 3 neighborhood are retained).

The corners with the minimal eigenvalue less than \texttt{qualityLevel} \cdot \max_{x,y} qualityMeasureMap(x,y) are rejected.

The remaining corners are sorted by the quality measure in the descending order.

Function throws away each corner for which there is a stronger corner at a distance less than maxDistance.

TODO: breifly explain cornerMinEigenVal() & cornerHarris() and the rest 
can just be pasted to the slides.
